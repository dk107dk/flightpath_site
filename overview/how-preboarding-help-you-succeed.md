## What is data preboarding?

Millions of companies around the world exchange regular datasets every day. When new data arrives it is too often dumped into the data lake, applications, or analytics systems without a methodical process. The result is that downstream data consumers cannot trust or explain the data they depend on.

Imagine if a retailer pulled boxes off a distributor's truck and dragged them directly to the front shop for people to buy. It would be mess â€” and it would never happen! Instead the retailer receives to shipment, unpacks it, inspects it for quantity, quality, and correctness, moves the new stock to the stock-keeping shelves and enters it in inventory, prices the goods, and only then moves some of them to the storefront for people to buy.&#x20;

Careful handling during the receipt of new data should be like this retail analogy. That's preboarding. The methodical process of durable identification, registration in an immutable staging area, idempotent validation and data upgrading, and publishing data and metadata to an immutable archive is key to bringing valuable information into the enterprise with low risk, high confidence, and greater efficiency.

## Preboarding rules FTW

Everyone who receives data does preboarding in some form. Too often the process is inconsistent, unexplainable, error prone, and too costly. In data management, shortcuts generally end up being expensive. There are a few simple rules for doing preboarding well. **FlightPath** and the [CsvPath Framework](https://www.csvpath.org/) can help you follow these guidelines and build a better process.

### Do it the same way every time



### Capture metadata at every step



### Identity data durably and traceably



### Be immutable from start to finish



### Be as declarative and function-specific as possible&#x20;



## Take the time to do it right

These few high-level guidelines are key to success. The other most important thing is taking the time to build the right process for the business you are supporting. Throwing bodies or handy tools built for other purposes at a preboarding problem may get you through the day, but in the long run, in data, expediencies tend to cause problems.&#x20;

For many companies, receiving a partner's data starts as a small effort to bring a limited amount of regular transactional data into the enterprise. But in a growing company, the small challenge of high-quality data intake sooner or later becomes becomes a bigger, knottier, and sometimes existential problem. A purpose-built data preboarding infrastructure like CsvPath Framework, coupled with FlightPath, can make the difference between lurching from data crisis to data crisis and sleeping well at night.
