# âœ¨ Features

## Project Management

FlightPath helps you manage projects so you can partition data flows for easier development and management. Keeping projects focused on one or a small number of data partnerships makes development more agile and allows you to better use compute resources for higher performance and greater scalability.

When you first open FlightPath the app creates a .`flightpath` JSON configuration file in your home directory that points to your `FlightPath` projects folder. You can change the project folder's location in FlightPath's config panel. Next FlightPath creates a `Default` project. In the `Default` project, and every new project, you will see an `examples` directory. You can delete the examples if you don't need them.&#x20;

Creating a new project is as simple as selecting `Create New Project` in the drop-down at the top of the right-hand files tree. Each time you create a project in FlightPath, FlightPath creates a new CsvPath Framework project, with a new config file, archive, logs, and other assets. Every project is completely separate, with its own choice of storage backends and integrations.&#x20;

## Stage Data

CsvPath Framework is all about automating the process of receiving data. But during development you typically need to stage data manually. FlightPath makes it easy. Add your data files using the `Copy data in` button on center of the home screen, or open the project directory and drag your data files in. &#x20;

Then you can simply right-click any file to stage it in your choice of storage backend by selecting `Stage data`.

Give the new named-file a simple, memorable name. Optionally, add a template if you want a particular filesystem path. You can include elements of the original file path in the template.

Now you see your staged data in the `Staged named-files` window at the top of FlightPath's right-hand operations column.
