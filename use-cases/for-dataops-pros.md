**Good to know:** depending on the product you're building, it can be useful to explicitly document use cases. Got a product that can be used by a bunch of people in different ways? Maybe consider splitting it out!

## Creating a new project

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Steps" %}
* Open FlightPath
* Click the Projects drop-down at the top left
* Select `Create new project`&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/create_new_project.png" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* Give the project a name and click `Ok`
* See that your project name is now selected and that two folders appear, `examples` and `transfers` . Examples are build-in how-tos that can be deleted. Transfers is just a folder that can be used for CsvPath Framework's  `transfer-mode`, or for copying files into the project, or deleted.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="What you need" %}
* A FlightPath install
* Awareness of local machine sandbox constraints on MacOS or any permissions constraints on Windows
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
